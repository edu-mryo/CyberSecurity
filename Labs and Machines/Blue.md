# Machine Name: Blue
**Platform:** Hack The Box
**Difficulty:**  Easy
**OS:** Windows

## Introduction

Blue, while possibly the most simple machine on Hack The Box, demonstrates the severity of the EternalBlue exploit, which has been used in multiple large-scale ransomware and crypto-mining attacks since it was leaked publicly.lenge.

## Recon

* **Nmap Scan:** `add nmap command here`
```bash
```

* **Directory Enumeration (if applicable):**
    * Tools used (Gobuster, Dirbuster, etc.)
    * Interesting directories or files discovered.
* **Other Recon Tools (if applicable):**
    * Mention any additional recon techniques or tools used.

## Vulnerability Identification

* **Vulnerability 1:**
    * Describe the identified vulnerability in detail.
    * ![Screenshot or PoC]
    * Explain the exploitation process.
* **Vulnerability 2 (if any):**
    * Repeat the same format for any additional vulnerabilities.

## Exploitation

* **Gaining Initial Access:**
    * Step-by-step explanation of how you exploited the vulnerability to gain initial access to the machine.
    * ```
      [Include any relevant code snippets or commands used]
      ```
* **Privilege Escalation (if applicable):**
    * Describe the privilege escalation technique used.
    * Provide details of any exploits or misconfigurations leveraged.
* **Proof of Access:**
    * ![Screenshot of flags or other evidence]

## Post-Exploitation

* **Further Enumeration:**
    * Any additional information gathered after gaining access (interesting files, configurations, etc.).
* **Lateral Movement (if applicable):**
    * Explain how you moved to other machines on the network (if any).

## Lessons Learned

* Key takeaways from the challenge.
* What you learned about the specific vulnerabilities or techniques used.
* Any areas where you could have improved your approach.

## Conclusion

* Summarize your overall experience with the machine.
* Highlight the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
* Offer any advice to others attempting the same machine.

**Happy hacking!**
