# Machine Name: Legacy
**Platform:** Hack The Box
**Difficulty:** Easy
**OS:** Windows

## Introduction

Legacy is a fairly straightforward beginner-level machine which demonstrates the potential security risks of SMB on Windows. Only one publicly available exploit is required to obtain administrator access.
## Recon

* **Nmap Scan:** `nmap legacy.htb -sVC -T4 -oN ~/Desktop/nmap/legacy.txt`

```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE      VERSION
135/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds Windows XP microsoft-ds
