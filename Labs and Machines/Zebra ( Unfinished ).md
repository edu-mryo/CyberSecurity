# Machine Name: Zebra
**Platform:** Hack The Box
**Difficulty:** Very Easy
**OS:** [Linux, Windows, etc.]


## Introduction

Zebra is a very easy Linux machine that showcases a recently disclosed local privilege escalation vulnerability (`CVE-2022-37393`) inÂ `Zimbra Collaboration`, which allows the zimbra user to elevate their privileges due to an insecure default sudo configuration which permits the execution of zmslapd as root with arbitrary parameters.

## Recon

* **Nmap Scan:** `nmap zebra.htb -Pn -T4 -sVC -oN ~/Desktop/nmap/zebra.txt `
