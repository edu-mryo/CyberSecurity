Q: What is the Least Functionality Principle?  
(1) A system should only run the necessary services and protocols, minimizing the attack surface.  
(2) A system should run all available services for maximum functionality.  
(3) A system should minimize user interaction to reduce errors.  
A: A system should only run the necessary services and protocols, minimizing the attack surface.

Q: What are Interfaces in the context of OS Security?  
(1) Connection points to the network, which should be disabled if not required.  
(2) User interfaces for interacting with the operating system.  
(3) APIs for connecting software applications.  
A: Connection points to the network, which should be disabled if not required.
