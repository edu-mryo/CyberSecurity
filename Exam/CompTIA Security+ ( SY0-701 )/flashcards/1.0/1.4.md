Q: Describe the process of creating and verifying a digital signature.
(1) The sender creates a message digest, signs it with their private key, and sends it with the message. The recipient verifies the signature with the sender\u2019s public key and compares the hash to ensure the message has not been tampered with.
(2) The sender encrypts the message with their private key and sends it. The recipient decrypts it with the sender\u2019s public key.
(3) The sender hashes the message and sends it. The recipient compares the hash to ensure the message has not been tampered with.
A: (1) The sender creates a message digest, signs it with their private key, and sends it with the message. The recipient verifies the signature with the sender\u2019s public key and compares the hash to ensure the message has not been tampered with.
