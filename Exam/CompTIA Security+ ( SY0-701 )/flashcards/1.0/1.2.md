Q: What is the core principle of the zero trust security model?

(1) All users are trusted if inside the network perimeter.

(2) Only external devices are considered threats.

(3) No device, user, or service is inherently trusted.
A: No device, user, or service is inherently trusted.

Q: How does the zero trust model handle user identity verification?  
(1) Verification is continuous and context-based.  
(2) Users are verified once during login.  
(3) Users are only verified when accessing sensitive resources.  
A: Verification is continuous and context-based.

Q: What is the purpose of threat scope reduction in a zero trust environment?  
(1) To limit access to only necessary resources, minimizing potential damage.  
(2) To provide all users with equal access to all resources.  
(3) To allow administrators more flexibility in granting permissions.  
A: To limit access to only necessary resources, minimizing potential damage.

Q: How does the zero trust model enforce access restrictions?  
(1) Through policy-driven access control considering user identity, device posture, and network context.  
(2) By requiring users to verify their identity once.  
(3) By enforcing access only based on device location.  
A: Through policy-driven access control considering user identity, device posture, and network context.

Q: What is Adaptive Identity in the context of the zero trust model?  
(1) Continuous identity verification based on the user’s context and resources accessed.  
(2) Static identity verification during login.  
(3) Verification based only on network location.  
A: Continuous identity verification based on the user’s context and resources accessed.

Q: What is Threat Scope Reduction?  
(1) Limiting access to network resources on a need-to-know basis.  
(2) Allowing all users access to non-sensitive resources.  
(3) Reducing the number of devices that can access the network.  
A: Limiting access to network resources on a need-to-know basis.

Q: What is Policy-Driven Access?  
(1) Enforcement of access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and network context.  
(2) Enforcement based solely on user roles.  
(3) Access granted based on device capabilities.  
A: Enforcement of access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and network context.

Q: Why is physical security crucial for cybersecurity?  
(1) It's the first line of defense, protecting physical assets that house digital data.  
(2) It prevents users from physically accessing any network devices.  
(3) It ensures digital attacks are detected before physical ones occur.  
A: It's the first line of defense, protecting physical assets that house digital data.

Q: What are examples of physical security measures in cybersecurity?  
(1) Access controls, surveillance systems, and environmental controls in data centers.  
(2) Network monitoring tools and firewalls.  
(3) User authentication systems and digital certificates.  
A: Access controls, surveillance systems, and environmental controls in data centers.

Q: What is zoning in physical security?  
(1) Creating restrictive security zones with controlled entry/exit points.  
(2) Dividing data by security level.  
(3) Limiting user access based on location.  
A: Creating restrictive security zones with controlled entry/exit points.

Q: What is a honeypot in cybersecurity?  
(1) A decoy system designed to lure attackers.  
(2) A system used to store backup data.  
(3) A tool used to encrypt sensitive information.  
A: A decoy system designed to lure attackers.

Q: What is a honeynet?  
(1) A network of interconnected honeypots.  
(2) A secure network for encrypted communication.  
(3) A system for monitoring network traffic.  
A: A network of interconnected honeypots.

Q: What is a honeytoken?  
(1) Fake data used to trigger alerts and track attacker behavior.  
(2) A token used for secure user authentication.  
(3) A token for encrypting sensitive data.  
A: Fake data used to trigger alerts and track attacker behavior.

Q: What is a DNS sinkhole?  
(1) Redirects suspicious traffic to a honeynet for analysis.  
(2) Blocks access to unsecured websites.  
(3) Prevents users from accessing malicious domains.  
A: Redirects suspicious traffic to a honeynet for analysis.
