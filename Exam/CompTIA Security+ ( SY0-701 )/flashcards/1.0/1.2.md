Q: What is the core principle of the zero trust security model?  
(1) All users are trusted if inside the network perimeter.  
(2) No device, user, or service is inherently trusted.  
(3) Only external devices are considered threats.  
A: (2) No device, user, or service is inherently trusted.

Q: How does the zero trust model handle user identity verification?  
(1) Users are only verified when accessing sensitive resources.  
(2) Verification is continuous and context-based. (3) Users are verified once during login.  
A: (2) Verification is continuous and context-based.

Q: What is the purpose of threat scope reduction in a zero trust environment?  
(1) To limit access to only necessary resources, minimizing potential damage.  
(2) To provide all users with equal access to all resources.  
(3) To allow administrators more flexibility in granting permissions.  
A: (1) To limit access to only necessary resources, minimizing potential damage.

Q: How does the zero trust model enforce access restrictions?  
(1) By enforcing access only based on device location.  
(2) Through policy-driven access control considering user identity, device posture, and network context.  
(3) By requiring users to verify their identity once.  
A: (2) Through policy-driven access control considering user identity, device posture, and network context.

Q: What is Adaptive Identity in the context of the zero trust model?  
(1) Static identity verification during login.  
(2) Verification based only on network location.  
(3) Continuous identity verification based on the user’s context and resources accessed.  
A: (3) Continuous identity verification based on the user’s context and resources accessed.

Q: What is Threat Scope Reduction?  
(1) Allowing all users access to non-sensitive resources.  
(2) Reducing the number of devices that can access the network.  
(3) Limiting access to network resources on a need-to-know basis.  
A: (3) Limiting access to network resources on a need-to-know basis.

Q: What is Policy-Driven Access?  
(1) Enforcement of access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and network context.  
(2) Access granted based on device capabilities.  
(3) Enforcement based solely on user roles.  
A: (1) Enforcement of access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and network context.

Q: Why is physical security crucial for cybersecurity?  
(1) It prevents users from physically accessing any network devices.  
(2) It's the first line of defense, protecting physical assets that house digital data.  
(3) It ensures digital attacks are detected before physical ones occur.  
A: (2) It's the first line of defense, protecting physical assets that house digital data.

Q: What are examples of physical security measures in cybersecurity?  
(1) Network monitoring tools and firewalls.  
(2) Access controls, surveillance systems, and environmental controls in data centers.  
(3) User authentication systems and digital certificates.  
A: (2) Access controls, surveillance systems, and environmental controls in data centers.

Q: What is zoning in physical security?  
(1) Creating restrictive security zones with controlled entry/exit points.  
(2) Limiting user access based on location.  
(3) Dividing data by security level.  
A: (1) Creating restrictive security zones with controlled entry/exit points.
