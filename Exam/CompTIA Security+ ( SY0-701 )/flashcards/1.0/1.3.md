Q: What is the core principle of the zero trust security model?  
(1) No device, user, or service is inherently trusted.  
(2) Devices within the network perimeter are trusted.  
(3) Only external users need to be verified.  
A: (1) No device, user, or service is inherently trusted.
<!--ID: 1723974830319-->


Q: How does the zero trust model handle user identity verification?  
(1) Verification is continuous and context-based.  
(2) Users are only verified at random intervals.  
(3) Users are verified once during login.  
A: (1) Verification is continuous and context-based.

Q: What is Threat Scope Reduction in a zero trust environment?  
(1) Restricting access to all network resources equally.  
(2) Limiting access to only necessary resources, minimizing potential damage.  
(3) Reducing the number of threats from external devices.  
A: (2) Limiting access to only necessary resources, minimizing potential damage.
<!--ID: 1723974830322-->


Q: How does the zero trust model enforce access restrictions?  
(1) By assigning static access permissions to all users.  
(2) By allowing unrestricted access to known devices.  
(3) Through policy-driven access control considering user identity, device posture, and network context.  
A: (3) Through policy-driven access control considering user identity, device posture, and network context.
