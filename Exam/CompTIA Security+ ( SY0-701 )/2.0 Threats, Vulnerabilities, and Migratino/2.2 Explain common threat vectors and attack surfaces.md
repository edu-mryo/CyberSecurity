## Attack Surface and Threat Vectors

**Summary**

- **What is an attack surface?** The total sum of potential vulnerabilities and entry points a threat actor can use to compromise a system. This includes network ports, applications, devices, and even users themselves.
- **Why minimize it?** By reducing the attack surface, you limit the opportunities for exploitation, thereby strengthening your security posture.
- **How to assess it?** Consider the following:
    - **Scope:** Define the area you're analyzing (entire organization, single server, web app, etc.).
    - **Threat Actor:** Focus on the types of attackers most likely to target you (external, internal, etc.).
    - **Threat Vectors:** Identify the paths attackers could use to achieve their goals (data theft, disruption, etc.).

**Key Concepts**

- **Attack Surface:** The total set of points where an unauthorized user (attacker) can try to enter data to or extract data from a system.
- **Threat Actor:** An individual or group that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in a system.
- **Threat Vector:** The path or method used by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to a system.
- **Attack Vector:** Sometimes used interchangeably with "threat vector," but can also refer specifically to a successfully exploited vulnerability.

## Vulnerable Software Vectors

**Summary**

- **Vulnerable Software:** Software with flaws that can be exploited to bypass security or crash the software. Due to the complexity and rapid development of software, vulnerabilities are common.
- **Impact:** Varies depending on the software affected. Can range from providing a foothold in the network to compromising cryptographic keys.
- **Unsupported Systems and Applications:** Software no longer receiving updates and patches from the vendor, making them highly vulnerable to exploits.
- **Isolation:** One strategy for dealing with unsupported applications is to isolate them to limit their exposure to potential threats. This is an example of a compensating control.
- **Scanning Software:** Tools used to identify and classify software vulnerabilities. Can be client-based (agent installed on each host) or agentless.

**Key Concepts**

- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.
- **Patch:** A piece of software designed to update a program and fix security vulnerabilities.
- **Patch Management:** The process of identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying patches for software.
- **Unsupported System:** A system that no longer receives updates or support from the vendor.
- **Compensating Control:** A security control that is put in place to mitigate a risk when a primary control cannot be implemented.
- **Client-Based Agent:** Software installed on a host that performs vulnerability scanning and reports to a management server.
- **Agentless Scanning:** A vulnerability scanning technique that does not require any software to be installed on the host.

## Network Vector

**Summary**

- **Exploit Techniques:** Exploiting software vulnerabilities can be done remotely (over a network) or locally (requiring authenticated access).
- **Unsecure Networks:** Networks lacking confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These become prime targets for threat actors.
- **Lack of Confidentiality:** Enables eavesdropping attacks, where attackers snoop on network traffic to steal sensitive information like passwords.
- **Lack of Integrity:** Allows on-path attacks, where attackers insert unauthorized devices to intercept, modify, or disrupt traffic.
- **Lack of Availability:** Opens the door to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, causing service disruptions.
- **Secure Networks:** Employ access control frameworks and cryptography to manage and protect network resources.
- **Threat Vectors in Unsecure Networks:**
    - Direct Access (physical access)
    - Wired Network (unauthorized devices)
    - Remote/Wireless Network (credential theft or protocol cracking)
    - Cloud Access (weak cloud credentials)
    - Bluetooth Network (malicious file transfer)
    - Default Credentials (unchanged default passwords)
    - Open Service Ports (unauthenticated connections)

**Key Concepts**

- **Remote Exploit:** A vulnerability that can be exploited over a network without authentication.
- **Local Exploit:** A vulnerability that requires authenticated access to the target system to exploit.
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is only accessible to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data.  
- **Availability:** Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.
- **Access Control Framework:** A structure that dictates how subjects access objects.
- **Cryptography:** The practice of securing information using encryption.
- **Eavesdropping Attack:** An attack where an attacker intercepts and listens to network traffic.
- **On-Path Attack:** An attack where an attacker inserts a device into the network to intercept and modify traffic.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:** An attack that aims to disrupt the availability of a service.

## Lure-Based Vectors

**Summary**

- **Lure:** A seemingly attractive or interesting item that conceals a dangerous payload (the "hook").
- **Purpose:** To trick a user into facilitating an attack, often by triggering a software vulnerability.
- **Common Lures:**
    - Removable Devices (e.g., USB drives, memory cards)
    - Executable Files (e.g., Trojan Horse malware)
    - Document Files (e.g., Word, PDF)
    - Image Files
- **Attack Surface:** Lures exploit various attack surfaces, including hardware (readers) and software (viewers/editors).
- **Mitigation:** Endpoint security measures like vulnerability management, antivirus software, program execution control, and intrusion detection help reduce this risk.

**Key Concepts**

- **Common Message-Based Vectors:**
    - Email (attachments)
    - SMS/Text Messages (file or link via SS7)
    - Instant Messaging (attachments, voice, video)
    - Web and Social Media (downloads, drive-by downloads, disinformation)
- **Zero-Click Exploits:** The most dangerous type, where merely receiving or viewing content triggers the exploit.
- **Pretexting Attacks:** Attackers use messaging to manipulate users into revealing sensitive information or weakening security settings.

**Key Concepts**

    - Vendor: Sells products to retail businesses (B2B) or customers (B2C).
    - Business Partner: A closer relationship with shared goals and marketing opportunities.
- **Supply Chain Complexity:** Each supplier and vendor has its own supply chain, creating a vast network of interconnected entities, each a potential point of vulnerability.
- **Trusted Supply Chain:** Requires ensuring that all entities involved in the supply chain are trustworthy. For most businesses, using reputable vendors is the most practical way to achieve this.
- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs):** Provide outsourced IT services. While convenient, they introduce complexity in monitoring and managing security due to potential insider threats.

**Key Concepts**

- **Supply Chain:** The network of all individuals, organizations, resources, activities, and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product.  
- **Supplier:** A company that provides goods or services to another company.

- **Business Partner:** A company that has a strategic relationship with another company, often involving shared resources and goals.
- **Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM):** A company that manufactures products that are then sold under another company's brand.
- **Insider Threat:** A security risk that originates from within an organization, often from employees, former employees, contractors, or business associates who have access to sensitive information.

```txt
People—employees, contractors, suppliers, and customers
—represent part of the attack surface of any
organization. Collectively, they are referred to as
the human vector. A person with permissions on the
system is a potential target of manipulative threat
actor techniques known as social engineering. Being
able to compare and contrast social engineering
techniques will help you to lead security awareness
training and to develop policies and other security
controls to mitigate these risks.
```

## Typosquatting

**Summary**

- **Impersonation:** A key element in both phishing and pharming attacks, requiring the attacker to convincingly mimic a trusted source.
- **Email Spoofing:** Manipulating email headers to make the "From" field display a fake name or address.
- **Typosquatting:** Registering domain names similar to legitimate ones, hoping users will overlook the typo and visit the malicious site. Also called cousin domains or lookalike domains.
