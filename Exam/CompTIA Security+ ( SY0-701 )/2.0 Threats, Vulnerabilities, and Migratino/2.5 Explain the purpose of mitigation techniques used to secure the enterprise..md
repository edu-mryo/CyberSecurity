## ENDPOINT HARDENING

**Overall Summary**: 
Operating system security involves safeguarding against threats and vulnerabilities by implementing a range of measures, including hardening, access controls, secure configurations, application security, and user awareness training. Hardening, a crucial aspect, involves modifying the operating system to enhance security, while balancing it with functionality and usability. Baselines and least functionality principles guide the configuration process. Interfaces, services, and application service ports must be strictly managed, and disk encryption is essential. Maintaining devices and staying updated on security threats is also vital.

**Workstations** play a pivotal role, requiring comprehensive endpoint hardening due to their large attack surface. Key practices include removing unnecessary software, limiting administrative privileges, managing application installations and updates, user training, and secure configuration settings.

**Baselines and Registry Settings** play a key role in configuration management. Separate baselines exist for various system types, and registry settings, especially on Windows domains, are crucial. Baseline deviation reporting, using tools like the Security Compliance Toolkit, helps ensure configuration adherence.

**Breaking down concepts and terms**:

- **Hardening:** The process of enhancing an operating system's or application's security by modifying settings and configurations.
- **Least Functionality:** The principle that a system should only run necessary protocols and services to minimize the attack surface.
- **Interfaces:** Connection points to the network that should be disabled if not required.
- **Services:** Libraries of functions for applications, unused ones should be disabled.
- **Application Service Ports:** Allow remote connections to applications and should be disabled or blocked if not needed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Holds user data and cached credentials; disk encryption is crucial.
- **Workstations:** User-operated devices requiring extensive hardening due to their diverse functions and large attack surface.
- **Endpoint Hardening:** Securing workstations by removing unnecessary software, managing privileges, and implementing security measures.
- **User Awareness Training:** Educating users on threats and promoting secure behaviors.
- **Baselines:** Standard guidelines for secure device configuration.
- **Registry Settings:** Configuration settings stored in the Windows registry.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** Apply policy settings to domain-joined computers.
- **Baseline Deviation Reporting:** Validating configurations against baseline templates using tools like the Security Compliance Toolkit.
