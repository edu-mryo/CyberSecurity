## ENDPOINT HARDENING

**Overall Summary**: 
Operating system security involves safeguarding against threats and vulnerabilities by implementing a range of measures, including hardening, access controls, secure configurations, application security, and user awareness training. Hardening, a crucial aspect, involves modifying the operating system to enhance security, while balancing it with functionality and usability. Baselines and least functionality principles guide the configuration process. Interfaces, services, and application service ports must be strictly managed, and disk encryption is essential. Maintaining devices and staying updated on security threats is also vital.

**Workstations** play a pivotal role, requiring comprehensive endpoint hardening due to their large attack surface. Key practices include removing unnecessary software, limiting administrative privileges, managing application installations and updates, user training, and secure configuration settings.

**Baselines and Registry Settings** play a key role in configuration management. Separate baselines exist for various system types, and registry settings, especially on Windows domains, are crucial. Baseline deviation reporting, using tools like the Security Compliance Toolkit, helps ensure configuration adherence.

**Breaking down concepts and terms**:

- **Hardening:** The process of enhancing an operating system's or application's security by modifying settings and configurations.
- **Least Functionality:** The principle that a system should only run necessary protocols and services to minimize the attack surface.
- **Interfaces:** Connection points to the network that should be disabled if not required.
- **Services:** Libraries of functions for applications, unused ones should be disabled.
- **Application Service Ports:** Allow remote connections to applications and should be disabled or blocked if not needed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Holds user data and cached credentials; disk encryption is crucial.
- **Workstations:** User-operated devices requiring extensive hardening due to their diverse functions and large attack surface.
- **Endpoint Hardening:** Securing workstations by removing unnecessary software, managing privileges, and implementing security measures.
- **User Awareness Training:** Educating users on threats and promoting secure behaviors.
- **Baselines:** Standard guidelines for secure device configuration.
- **Registry Settings:** Configuration settings stored in the Windows registry.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** Apply policy settings to domain-joined computers.
- **Baseline Deviation Reporting:** Validating configurations against baseline templates using tools like the Security Compliance Toolkit.

**Breaking down concepts and terms:**

- **Device Hardening:** This involves minimizing potential vulnerabilities in a system by configuring network and system settings, thereby reducing the attack surface.
- **Segmentation:** A crucial practice for securing an enterprise environment by isolating systems and limiting the spread of cyberattacks or malware.
- **Isolation:** Segregating individual devices within a network to limit their interaction, enhancing endpoint protection and preventing lateral threat spread.
- **Antivirus and Antimalware:** Essential tools for detecting and preventing various types of malware, though signature-based detection alone is insufficient for data breach prevention.
- **Disk Encryption (FDE):** Encrypts the entire contents of a drive or volume, including system files and folders, to ensure data protection even if the storage device is removed or accessed directly.
- **Patch Management:** A crucial process for addressing vulnerabilities in operating systems, software applications, and firmware by applying updates or patches.

## ADVANCED ENDPOINT PROTECTION

This text describes various endpoint security tools and techniques: EDR, XDR, HIDS/HIPS, and UBA/UEBA. It highlights their functions, key differences, and how they contribute to detecting and preventing security threats.

 Breaking Down Concepts and Terms:

- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: Focuses on protecting endpoint devices by collecting and analyzing data to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.  
- **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)**: Expands on EDR by providing broader visibility and response capabilities, incorporating data from various sources beyond endpoints.  
- **HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection) and HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention)**: Software tools that monitor and protect individual hosts from unauthorized access and malicious activities.  
- **UBA (User Behavior Analytics) or UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)**: A cybersecurity approach that monitors and analyzes user behavior to detect anomalies indicative of potential threats.  
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: A core feature of HIDS that audits key system files to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
