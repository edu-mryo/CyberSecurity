In this lesson, you will&#x20;

* Compare and contrast attributes and motivations of threat actor types.
* Explain common threat vectors and attack surfaces.

### Vulnerability, Threat and Risk

* Vulnerability → a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach
* Improper configuration, software and/or hardware
* Threat → the potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability and breach security
* Someone that poses threat is threat actor / agent&#x20;
* Path or tool used by actors are called threat vector
* Risk → level of hazard posed by vulnerabilities and threats

### Attribute of Threat Actors

The sophisticated nature of modern cybersecurity threats requires the creation of profiles of threat actor types and behaviors. This analysis involves identifying the attributes of threat actors' location, capability, resources/funding, and motivation.

* Internal / External → Threat actors might be internal ( employee for eg ) or external. Internal actors can be more dangerous as they might have certain permission and access to data than external threat&#x20;
* Sophistication / Capability → Capability and sophistication varies by the skills and ability of the threat actors. Some of the most advanced threat actors usually has sponsorship and have great experiences.
* Resource / Funding → Some cyber attacks are funded by nation state or illegal groups, ( organized crimes )&#x20;

### Motivations of threat actors

Motivation is the reason why threat actors perpetrate the attacks. Here are some of the motivations and general strategies

* Chaotic Motivation → Less common lately. Threat actors commit attacks simply for chaos and disruption. They usually do such attacks to prove their skills and capabilities
* Financial Motivation → Threat actors commit attacks for some financial gains.
* Blackmail → demand payment to prevent certain information to be leaked
* Extortion → demand payment to prevent or halt some type of attack
* Fraud → falsify information, tampering accounts etc
* Political Motivation → An attack to bring about some type of change in society and governance.

Regardless of the motivation, here are the  grand strategies the threat actors could use to achieve objectives

* Service Disruption → prevents companies/organizations from working as it does&#x20;
* Data Exfiltration → Transfer some confidential information to external machines&#x20;
* Disinformation → Spreading misinformation via online ( mostly )&#x20;

### Hackers and Hactivists

* Hackers →  individuals who have the skills to gain access to computer systems through unauthorized or unapproved means.&#x20;
* Unskilled Attacker → someone who uses hacker tools without necessarily understanding how they work or having the ability to craft new attacks
* Hacker Team / Hacktivist → A group uses cyber weapons to promote a political agenda.&#x20;

### Nations-State Actors

* Nation-state Actors → A type of threat actor that is supported by the resources of its host country's military and security services.
* The goals of state actors are primarily disinformation and espionage for strategic advantage

### Internal Threat Actors

An internal threat (or insider threat) arises from an actor identified by the organization and granted some type of access.&#x20;

* Main motivation of internal threat actors → revenge and financial gain
* Shadow IT → Computer hardware, software, or services used on a private network without authorization from the system owner.
