* **Microsoft Windows:** Large install base, making vulnerabilities widespread. Common issues include buffer overflows, input validation problems, and privilege flaws.
* **Apple macOS:** UNIX-based architecture, smaller user base than Windows. Vulnerabilities often found in access controls, secure boot processes, and third-party software.
* **Linux:** Prevalent server OS, open-source nature. Kernel vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unpatched systems are common problems. Widespread use in the cloud and server infrastructure makes vulnerabilities significant.
* **Mobile OS (Android/iOS):** Increasingly popular targets due to widespread adoption. Android's open-source nature and fragmentation lead to inconsistent patching. iOS has also seen significant vulnerabilities.

**Key Concepts**

Web and cloud-based applications introduce unique vulnerability concerns stemming from various sources, such as misconfigurations, insecure coding practices, and the use of third-party components with known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, disrupt services, or even compromise entire systems. 

...developers and security professionals must employ secure coding practices, perform regular vulnerability assessments, and implement robust access controls. It is also essential to keep third-party components up to date and follow cloud provider-specific security recommendations. 
```
