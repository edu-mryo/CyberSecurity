The preparation phase of incident response identifies data sources that
can support investigations. It also provisions tools to aggregate and
correlate this data and partially automate its analysis to drive an 
alerting and monitoring system. While automated detection is a huge 
support for the security team, it cannot identify all indicators of 
malicious activity. As an incident responder, you must be able to 
identify signs in data sources that point to a particular type of attack.

## Computer Viruses

**Summarry**

A computer virus is a type of malware designed to replicate and spread by infecting executable applications or program code. There are several types of viruses based on the files or media they infect:

- **Non-resident/File Infector:** The virus is in a host executable file and infects other processes when the host runs.
- **Memory Resident:** The virus creates a process in memory when the host file is executed, staying active even if the host is terminated.
- **Boot:** The virus infects the disk boot sector or partition table and becomes active when the OS starts.
- **Script and Macro Viruses:** These use local scripting engines, such as PowerShell or JavaScript, or embedded code in documents like VBA in Microsoft Office files.
- **Multipartite:** These use multiple infection vectors.
- **Polymorphic:** These viruses change or obfuscate their code to evade detection.

All these viruses need a host file or media to spread, which can be distributed via disks, networks, email attachments, social media, or website downloads.

- **Fileless Malware:**
    - Doesn't store its code on disk, making it harder to detect.
    - Often uses memory-resident techniques and legitimate system tools (like PowerShell and WMI) to operate.
    - Relies on obfuscation and on-the-fly compilation to evade detection.
- **Terminology:**
    - APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and AVT (Advanced Volatile Threat) are types of modern fileless malware.
    - LOC (Low-Observable Characteristics) attacks are another term for this type of threat.

**Key Concepts & Definitions:**

- **Computer Worm:** Self-replicating malware that can spread across networks without user intervention.
- **Virus:** Malware that requires user action to execute and spread.

## TTPS AND IOCS

**Summary**

- **Traditional Antivirus (A-V) scanners:** Rely on signature-based detection, comparing files against a database of known malware code. While still useful for common threats, it's no longer sufficient due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks.
    
- **Modern Threat Detection:** Focuses on identifying malicious behavior patterns by analyzing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
    
- **Tactics:** Broad descriptions of attacker goals, like reconnaissance or privilege escalation.
    
- **Techniques:** The methods used to achieve those goals, such as vulnerability scanning or phishing.
    
- **Procedures:** Specific steps involved in executing a technique, often revealing attacker tools and methodologies.
    
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Signs of a successful or ongoing attack. These are evidence of TTPs in action.
    
**The evolution of cyber threats has made signature-based antivirus insufficient. Modern threat detection emphasizes identifying malicious behavior by analyzing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).** TTPs help understand the attacker's goals (Tactics), the methods they employ (Techniques), and the specific actions they take (Procedures). IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) serve as evidence of these TTPs, offering insights into past or ongoing attacks.

- **Variety of IoCs:** The multitude of attack targets and vectors results in a vast array of potential IoCs, from malware signatures to anomalous activity patterns.
    
- **Threat Intelligence and AI:** Resources like the MITRE ATT&CK database document known TTPs and IoCs, aiding in automated threat detection. AI-powered systems enhance the analysis and response capabilities of modern threat protection suites.
    
- **IoCs vs. IoAs:** While IoCs signify successful attacks, IoAs (Indicators of Attack) indicate potential intrusion attempts.
    

**The vast number of potential IoCs necessitates resources like the MITRE ATT&CK database, which documents known threats, and the utilization of AI for effective threat detection and response.** AI plays a crucial role in analyzing patterns of anomalous activity, enabling timely identification of potential intrusions. IoCs, indicating successful attacks, differ from IoAs (Indicators of Attack), which suggest attempts at intrusion.

## MALICIOUS ACTIVITY INDICATORS

Overall Summary:
This text focuses on recognizing various indicators of malware and malicious activity on a system. It covers behavioral signs like abnormal resource consumption, file system alterations, and account compromise, as well as investigative techniques like sandbox analysis.

Breaking down concepts and terms:

- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.
- **Sandbox:** An isolated environment used to test and observe the behavior of potentially malicious code without affecting the production network.
- **Sheep dip:** A dedicated, isolated host used to scan and test new software and removable media for malware before allowing it into the production network.
- **Resource Consumption:** The use of system resources like CPU, memory, disk, and network bandwidth. Abnormal consumption can be an indicator of malware activity.
- **File System:** The structure on a storage device that organizes and stores files and data. Malicious code often interacts with the file system, leaving traces that can be detected.
- **Registry:** A hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system and installed applications. Malware might modify the registry to maintain persistence or evade detection.
