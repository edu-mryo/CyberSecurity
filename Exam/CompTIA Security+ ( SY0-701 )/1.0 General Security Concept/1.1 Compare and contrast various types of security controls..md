#### Security Control Categories

* Security Controls → A technology or procedure put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.
* Managerial → oversight of the information system.&#x20;
* risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.
* Operational →  implementing operations primarily by people.&#x20;
* security guards and training programs
* Technical → a system (hardware, software, or firmware) control.
* &#x20;firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls.&#x20;
* Physical → controls such as alarms, gateways, locks, lighting, and security cameras that deter and detect access to premises and hardware

#### Security Control Functional Types

* Aside from the four Security Control Categories, security control can be also defined by goal, or function it performs
* Preventive →  to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. A preventive control operates before an attack can take place
* Access control lists (ACL) configured on firewalls and file system objects&#x20;
* Antimalware software acts as a preventive control by blocking malicious processes from executing.&#x20;
* Detective → identify and record an attempted or successful intrusion. A detective control operates during an attack.
* &#x20;Logs provide one of the best examples of detective-type controls.
* Corrective → eliminates or reduces the impact of a security policy violation. A corrective control is used after an attack.&#x20;
* backup system that restores data that was damaged during an intrusion.&#x20;
* patch management system that eliminates the vulnerability exploited during the attack.
* Directive → enforces a rule of behavior, such as a policy, best practice standard, or standard operating procedure (SOP).&#x20;
* employee's contract will set out disciplinary procedures or causes for dismissal if they do not comply with policies and procedures.&#x20;
* Training and awareness programs can also be considered as directive controls.
* Deterrent → may not physically or logically prevent access, but it psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion.
* warnings of legal penalties against trespass or intrusion.
* Compensating → a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.

#### Information Security Roles and Responsibilities

* In order to adopt an effective organisational security posture, employees should understand their responsibilities. Organisation should also understand the roles they must appoint
* Chief Information Officer (CIO) → role who takes overall responsibility for IT function
* Chief Technology Officer (CTO) → role who is more focused on implementing and using new technology effectively
* Chief Security Officer (CSO) → In larger organisations , it is typical to appoint an officer specialised in security.&#x20;
* Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) → role specifically focused on implementing , maintaining and monitoring security policies

#### Information Security Competencies

* IT professionals in the world of security must wear different hats and must be competent in below activities
* Participate in risk assessment and testing security systems
* install, and configure secure devices and software
* Set up and maintain document access control and user privilege profiles.
* Monitor audit logs, review user privilege&#x20;
* Manage security related incidents
* Create and test business continuity plan&#x20;
* Participate in Security trainings and education programmes

#### Information Security Business Unit

* Security Operation Centre (SOC) →  a location where security professionals monitor and protect critical information assets across other business functions, Due to cost, SOC is usually employed by large corporations, like a government agency or a healthcare company.&#x20;
* Development and Security Operations (DevSecOps) → A combination of software development, security operations, and systems operations, and refers to the practice of integrating each discipline with the others.
* Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) →  a single point of contact for the notification of security incidents. This function might be handled by the SOC&#x20;
