#### Information Security

* Information Security ( infosec in short ) → protection of data resources from unauthorised access, attack, theft, or damage.
* Secure information has three properties, often referred to as the CIA Triad:&#x20;
* Confidentiality → information can only be read by people who have been explicitly authorised to access it.
* Integrity → data is stored and transferred as intended and that any modification is authorised
* Availability → information is readily accessible to those authorised to view or modify it.&#x20;
* The idea of Non-Repudiation is also crucial in the world of security
* Non-Repudiation → a person cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource

#### Cybersecurity Framework

* cybersecurity refers specifically to provisioning secure processing hardware and software
* cybersecurity tasks can be classified as five functions, following the framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \[https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/getting-started/online-learning/five-functions]
* Identify → Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
* Protect → procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operation's lifecycle.
* Detect → proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
* Respond → identify, analyse, contain, and eradicate threats
* Recover → implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.
* A cybersecurity framework guides the selection and configuration of controls.&#x20;
* Frameworks are important because they save an organisation from building its security program in a vacuum, or from building the program on a foundation that fails to account for important security concepts.
* The use of a framework allows an organisation to make an objective statement of its current cybersecurity capabilities, identify a target level of capability, and prioritise investments to achieve that target.

#### Gap Analysis

* Gap Analysis → a process that identifies how an organisation's security systems deviate from those required or recommended by a framework.&#x20;
* performed when first adopting a framework or when meeting a new industry or legal compliance requirement.&#x20;
* Gap analysis might be repeated every few years to meet compliance requirements or to validate any changes that have been made to the framework.

#### Access Control

* access control → ensure an information system meets the goals of the CIA triad.&#x20;
* Access control governs how subjects/principals may interact with objects.&#x20;
* Subjects → people, devices,  software processes, or any other system that can request and be granted access to a resource.&#x20;
* Objects → the resources. Objects could be a network, server, database, app, or file. Subjects are assigned rights or permissions on resources.
* Identity and Access Management ( IAM for short ) → A security process that provides identification, authentication, and authorization mechanisms for users, computers, and other entities to work with organisational assets like networks, operating systems, and applications.
* Identification → creating an account or ID that uniquely represents the user, device, or process on the network.&#x20;
* Authentication → proving that a subject is who or what it claims to be when it attempts to access the resource.&#x20;
* people might be authenticated by providing a password;&#x20;
* a computer system could be authenticated using a token such as a digital certificate.
* Authorization → determining what rights subjects should have on each resource, and enforcing those rights.&#x20;
* Accounting → tracking authorised usage of a resource or use of rights by a subject and alerting when unauthorised use is detected or attempted.&#x20;

#### Zero Trust&#x20;

**Zero Trust Security Model:**

The zero trust security model is built on the idea that nothing is inherently trusted within a network. Instead, every access request, whether from inside or outside the network perimeter, is thoroughly verified. Key concepts within this model include:

* Adaptive Identity: Identity verification is ongoing and adapts based on a user's current context and resources they need.
* Threat Scope Reduction: Access is granted on a need-to-know basis to minimize potential damage from attacks.
* Policy-Driven Access Control: Strict policies, considering user identity, device health, and network context, govern who can access what.

**Control Plane**

The control plane is the brains of the zero-trust architecture. It houses the Policy Decision Point (PDP), which is the central authority for making access decisions.

1. Policy Engine: This is the core of the PDP. It's like a powerful computer that analyzes a vast amount of information. It looks at:

* Subject and host identities and credentials: Who is trying to access the resource and what device are they using?
* Access control policies: What are the rules about who can access what?
* Threat intelligence: Are there any known threats related to this access request?
* Behavioral analytics: Is the user behaving normally or is their behavior suspicious?
* Host and network security scanning and monitoring results: Is the device and the network it's on secure?

3. Using all this data, the policy engine determines whether or not to allow access.
4. Policy Administrator: Once the policy engine makes a decision, the policy administrator takes action. It communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in the data plane to either:

* Issue an access token and establish a secure session if access is granted.
* Deny access or terminate an existing session if access is denied or revoked.

**Data Plane**

The data plane is where the actual communication happens. It's the highway where data travels between subjects (users or services) and resources (applications or servers).

1. Subjects: These are the entities requesting access to resources. They could be human users or automated services.
2. Systems: These are the devices that subjects use to access resources, like laptops, smartphones, or servers.
3. Resources: These are the applications or data that subjects want to access.
4. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The PEP is like a traffic cop on the data highway. It sits between the subject and the resource and enforces the access decisions made by the policy engine in the control plane. If access is granted, the PEP establishes a secure connection, often in the form of an implicit trust zone, which is a temporary, encrypted tunnel for data transfer.

**Key Points**

* The separation of the control plane and data plane is essential in Zero Trust. It allows for centralized policy management and enforcement, making it easier to maintain security and adapt to changing threats.
* The policy engine is the heart of the control plane, making intelligent access decisions based on a wide range of factors.
* The PEP is the enforcer in the data plane, carrying out the decisions made by the policy engine.
* Implicit trust zones are temporary, secure connections that are established for specific transactions, minimizing the attack surface.

#### Physical Security&#x20;

* Foundation of Protection: Physical security is the first and most fundamental layer of defense in cybersecurity.
* Asset Protection: It safeguards the physical components (servers, data centers, etc.) housing critical digital data.
* Diverse Measures: This includes access controls, surveillance systems, and environmental controls in sensitive areas.
* Technical Security Parallels: Physical access controls share principles with technical security:
* Authentication (verifying identity)
* Authorization (controlling access points)
* Accounting (tracking access)
* Zoning Strategy: Often involves creating zones with increasingly restrictive security measures as one progresses inward.

**Site layout, Fencing and lighting**

Physical security through environmental design uses the built environment to deter and prevent crime. This approach involves strategically designing buildings, landscapes, and public spaces to incorporate non-obvious security features. By doing so, organizations can enhance security, discourage criminal activity, and create a safer environment for everyone. This approach is often cost-effective and can be implemented in both new and existing structures.

* Barricades and Entry/Exit Points: Control access, funnel people through specific areas, and use authentication mechanisms.
* Fencing: Transparent, robust barriers to deter intruders.
* Lighting: Improves visibility, deters crime, and enhances surveillance.
* Bollards: Physical barriers that prevent vehicle access to restricted areas.
* Existing Structures: Strategically locate secure zones, use signage, control traffic flow, and enhance visibility in public areas.

#### Deception and disruption Technology&#x20;

Deception and disruption technologies are active cybersecurity defense mechanisms that make attacks more challenging and costly for malicious actors. They use decoy systems, networks, and data to distract and analyze attackers, ultimately enhancing an organization's security posture.

**Deception Technologies:**

* Honeypot: A decoy system designed to mimic real targets and lure attackers. It helps gather information about attack methods and tools.
* Honeynet: A network of interconnected honeypots, simulating a larger, more complex environment to deceive and monitor attackers.
* Honeyfile: A fake file appearing to contain valuable information, used to detect unauthorized access attempts.
* Honeytoken: False credentials or data used to trigger alerts and track attacker behavior.

**Disruption Technologies:**

* Bogus DNS entries: False DNS records leading to non-existent hosts, wasting attackers' time and resources.
* Decoy web directories/pages: Dynamically generated or misleading web content to confuse automated scanning tools.
* Port triggering/spoofing: Manipulating responses to port scans to mislead attackers about open ports.
* DNS sinkhole: Redirecting suspicious traffic to a controlled environment (like a honeynet) for analysis.
