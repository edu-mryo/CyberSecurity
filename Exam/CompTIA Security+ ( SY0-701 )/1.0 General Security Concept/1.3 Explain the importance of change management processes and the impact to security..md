#### Change Management Program

Change management is a structured process that governs how modifications, big or small, are introduced to an organization's systems, products, or services. It's a critical discipline that ensures changes are made in a controlled and coordinated manner, minimizing negative impacts and maximizing positive outcomes.

The change management process typically includes the following stages:

1. Request: Someone identifies a need for change and submits a formal request.
2. Assessment: The change is evaluated for its feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with business goals.
3. Approval: Key stakeholders review and approve the change before it's implemented.
4. Implementation: The change is carefully rolled out, often during a pre-planned maintenance window.
5. Review: After implementation, the change is reviewed to ensure it has achieved its intended results.

Change management is not just about IT. It affects everyone in the organization, from end-users who need to be trained on new systems to executives who need to understand the business impact of the change. Effective change management requires collaboration and communication across all levels of the organization.

By prioritizing change management, organizations can embrace change as an opportunity for growth and innovation, rather than a source of risk and disruption.

#### Allowed and Blocked Changes

Allow lists and deny lists are tools used in change management to control what changes are permitted or prohibited. In the context of change management, these lists can refer to types of changes, software, hardware, or even individuals. Allow lists streamline processes for pre-approved, low-risk changes, while deny lists act as a safeguard against unauthorized or risky modifications.

* Allow List (Whitelist):
* In change management: A list of pre-approved changes, software, hardware, or individuals that are not subject to the full change management process.
* In technical controls: A list of entities (e.g., IP addresses, applications) explicitly allowed to access a system or network.
* Deny List (Blacklist):
* In change management: A list of prohibited changes, software, hardware, or individuals that are blocked from being implemented or must go through a strict change management process.
* In technical controls: A list of entities explicitly denied access to a system or network.

#### Restarts, Dependencies, and Downtime

Service and application restarts, along with potential downtime, are crucial considerations in change management. They directly impact business operations, so minimizing disruptions is a primary goal. Understanding dependencies between systems, developing backout plans, and carefully planning downtime contingencies are essential for successful change implementation. Legacy systems pose unique challenges due to outdated technology, limited documentation, and lack of vendor support, requiring special attention during change management.

* Service/Application Restart: The process of stopping and restarting a service or application to apply changes or resolve issues.
* Downtime: The period during which a service or application is unavailable, either planned (scheduled downtime) or unplanned (unscheduled downtime).
* Maintenance Window: A predefined time period for implementing changes to minimize disruption.
* Dependencies: The relationships between systems or applications where one relies on another to function correctly.
* Backout Plan: A contingency plan to reverse changes if implementation fails.
* Legacy System: An outdated computer system or application still in use, often with limited support and documentation.

#### Documentation and Version Control

version control and change management are crucial in maintaining accurate documentation and ensuring smooth transitions when changes are made to systems or applications. It highlights the different types of documentation that are typically affected by change management and emphasizes the need for regular updates to keep these documents current and relevant.

Version Control: The practice of tracking and managing changes to documents or code to maintain a history of revisions, ensure authorized modifications, and enable easy rollback to previous versions if needed.

Change Management: A structured approach to implementing changes to systems or applications, including assessing impacts, developing plans, conducting testing, and updating relevant documentation and training materials.

Documentation Types: The text mentions several types of documentation affected by change management:

* Change requests
* Policies and procedures
* System/process documentation
* Configuration management documentation
* Training materials
* Incident response and recovery plans
