## Cryptographic Concept

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into a secret code (ciphertext). This is in direct contrast to "security through obscurity," which relies on hiding the information, a method that is often unreliable, especially in computer systems. Cryptography ensures that even if the existence and location of the secret are known, the information remains unintelligible without the correct decoding method.

Key terminology in cryptography includes:

* Plaintext: The original, unencrypted message.
* Ciphertext: The encrypted, unreadable message.
* Algorithm: The procedure used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
* Cryptanalysis: The process of attempting to break cryptographic systems.

there are three main types of cryptographic algorithms, each with a role in ensuring security properties like confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation:

* Hashing algorithms
* Symmetric encryption ciphers
* Asymmetric encryption ciphers

## Symmetric Encryption**

Encryption algorithms, or ciphers, transform data into a secure format (ciphertext) using a key. Only those with the correct key can decrypt and access the original information.

Substitution and Transposition Algorithms

These are fundamental building blocks of encryption:

* Substitution: Replaces characters or blocks of text with different ones (e.g., ROT13).
* Transposition: Rearranges the order of characters or blocks without altering them.

Modern algorithms combine these techniques in complex ways to resist cryptanalysis (code-breaking).

Symmetric Algorithms

Symmetric algorithms use the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. This method is fast and efficient for large amounts of data.

Key Exchange Challenge

The main weakness of symmetric encryption is securely exchanging the key between parties. If an attacker (Mallory) intercepts the key, the confidentiality of the data is compromised.

Limitations of Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption does not provide authentication or integrity. Since both parties use the same key, either could have created the ciphertext, and the message's contents could be altered without detection.

## Key Length

Encryption algorithms use keys to add a layer of security. A key is a value that modifies the encryption process, ensuring that even if the encryption method is known, the ciphertext remains unreadable without the correct key.

Keyspace and Brute Force Attacks

The keyspace refers to the range of possible key values. Larger keyspaces offer more security as they make brute force attacks (trying all possible key combinations) impractical due to the vast number of possibilities.

Key Length and Strength

Modern symmetric ciphers use keys with a specific length, measured in bits. The number of bits determines the keyspace and thus the algorithm's resistance to brute force attacks. For example, AES-128 has 2^128 possible key values, while AES-256 has 2^256, a vastly larger keyspace.

Trade-offs of Larger Keys

While larger keys enhance security, they also require more computational resources (memory and processing power) for encryption and decryption operations.

## Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption utilizes two distinct but related keys: a public key (shared openly) and a private key (kept secret). A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. This property allows for secure communication without the need for a pre-shared secret key.

Key Exchange Process:

1. Bob generates a key pair and keeps the private key confidential.
2. Bob shares the public key with Alice.
3. Alice encrypts her message using Bob's public key.
4. Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
5. Bob decrypts the message using his private key.

Even if Mallory intercepts the encrypted message and the public key, she cannot decrypt it without Bob's private key.

Asymmetric Algorithms and Key Lengths:

Several algorithms implement asymmetric encryption:

* RSA: Requires a 2048-bit private key for adequate security.
* ECC: Offers similar security to RSA with shorter 256-bit keys.

## Hashing

Cryptographic hashing algorithms transform input data (plaintext) into a fixed-length string of bits called a hash or message digest. This process is one-way (irreversible), meaning you cannot recover the original data from the hash. Additionally, different inputs are highly unlikely to produce the same hash (collision resistance).

Proving Integrity with Hashing:

Hashing is primarily used to verify the integrity of data. For example:

1. Password Verification: Instead of storing plain text passwords, systems store their hashes. When a user logs in, the entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. A match confirms the correct password without revealing it.
2. File Integrity Verification: The hash of a file is published alongside it. After downloading, the user can calculate the hash of the downloaded file and compare it to the published one. A match indicates the file has not been tampered with during transmission.

Hash Algorithm Implementations:

* SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm): Considered the most robust, with variants like SHA256 producing 256-bit digests.
* MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5): Produces 128-bit digests. While not as secure as SHA256, it might be needed for compatibility with older systems.

Important Note: Even if an attacker replaces a file, they cannot easily change the published hash to match the altered file. Any mismatch indicates a compromised file.

## Digital Signature

A cryptographic primitive is a fundamental component such as a hash function, symmetric cipher, or asymmetric cipher. Cryptographic systems often combine these primitives within a cipher suite to achieve various security goals. Encryption ensures confidentiality, while cryptographic ciphers also provide integrity and authentication.

Public key cryptography authenticates the sender by using a private key, while hashing ensures message integrity. These methods can be combined to create digital signatures, which authenticate messages and ensure data integrity during transmission.

The process of using digital signatures involves the sender creating a hash of the message, signing it with their private key, and sending both the message and the signature to the recipient. The recipient then verifies the signature with the senderâ€™s public key and compares the hash to ensure the message has not been tampered with.

There are several standards for creating digital signatures, including PKCS#1 for RSA, DSA using ElGamal, and the widely used ECDSA developed under US government standards.

## Certificate Authorities

Public key cryptography (PKI) is a system designed to enhance the security and trustworthiness of digital communications. It addresses the core challenge of how to verify the identity of the owner of a public key. This is particularly crucial in e-commerce and other online transactions where the authenticity of the parties involved is paramount.

PKI achieves this verification through digital certificates. When an entity wants to establish trust, it creates a digital certificate that contains its public key. This certificate is then signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), which acts as a trusted third party. The CA's signature on the certificate essentially vouches for the identity of the certificate holder, asserting that the public key genuinely belongs to the entity it claims to represent.

There are two main types of CAs: private and third-party. Private CAs are typically used within organizations for internal communications, while third-party CAs are used for public and business-to-business communications. Reputable third-party CAs, such as Comodo, DigiCert, and others, play a crucial role in establishing trust across the internet.

The functions of a third-party CA are comprehensive and essential. They offer a range of certificate services, ensuring the validity of certificates and verifying the identity of applicants. They also work to build trust with users, governments, and businesses. CAs manage repositories that store certificates and are responsible for key and certificate lifecycle management, including revoking invalid certificates.

Key Concepts and Explanations

* Public Key Cryptography: A cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys (public and private) for secure communication and authentication.
* Public Key: A key that is openly distributed and used for encryption or signature verification.
* Private Key: A key that is kept secret and used for decryption or signing.
* Digital Certificate: An electronic document that binds a public key to an identity, usually the name of a person or organization.
* Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted third party that issues and manages digital certificates.
* Private CA: A CA that is used within an organization for internal communications.
* Third-Party CA: A CA that is used for public and business-to-business communications.

## Digital Certificates

A digital certificate is a structured digital document that securely houses a subject's public key. It acts as a verifiable container of information, including not only the public key itself but also details about the entity the certificate is issued to (the subject) and the issuing authority (the Certificate Authority, or CA). The certificate's authenticity and integrity are ensured through a digital signature, which cryptographically confirms that the CA issued it to the intended subject. The subject can be a person, such as in the case of certificates used for signing email messages, or a machine, like a web server facilitating secure online transactions.

These digital certificates adhere to the X.509 standard, a widely recognized format established by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Additionally, RSA, a leading cybersecurity company, has developed a set of standards known as Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), which further promote the adoption and use of public key infrastructure, the framework within which digital certificates operate.

## Root of Trust

The root of trust model establishes how users and Certificate Authorities (CAs) trust each other within a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The foundation of this model is the root certificate, a self-signed certificate issued by the CA to itself. This root certificate, typically using a strong RSA or ECC key, acts as the ultimate trust anchor.

Different CA Models

1. Single CA Model: A single root CA issues certificates directly to end users and devices. This model is often used in private networks but is vulnerable if the CA is compromised.
2. Hierarchical Model (Third-Party CAs): A root CA issues certificates to intermediate CAs, which then issue certificates to end entities (leaf certificates). This model offers flexibility, scalability, and better trust management.
3. Self-Signed Certificates: Used when traditional PKI is too complex or costly. Often found in development, testing, or consumer-grade devices. These certificates lack external validation and should not be used for critical systems.

## Certificate Signing Requests

1. Registration with the CA:

* End-users initiate the process by registering an account with a Certificate Authority (CA).
* The CA's specific procedures for user authorization and identity verification vary based on their implementation.
* For instance, in a Windows domain network, users and devices often auto-enroll by simply authenticating to Active Directory.
* Third-party CAs might employ a range of verification methods to ensure the legitimacy of the user's identity.
* The CA prioritizes verifying the legitimacy of users to maintain its reputation.

3. Certificate Request Preparation:

* The user generates a key pair, consisting of a private and public key, using a chosen cipher (e.g., RSA or ECC) and key length.
* The private key must be kept confidential and known solely by the user.
* The user fills out a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submits it to the CA.
* The CSR includes the information the user wants in the certificate, such as their public key.

5. CA Review and Approval:

* The CA reviews the CSR, verifying the validity of the provided information.
* For a web server, this might involve confirming that the subject name matches the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and that the CSR was initiated by the person authorized to manage the domain.
* If the request meets the CA's requirements, they sign the certificate and send it to the user.

Explanation of Key Concepts and Terms

* Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted entity that issues digital certificates.
* Registration: The process by which users create an account with a CA to request certificates.
* Key Pair: A set of cryptographic keys, one private and one public, used for secure communication.
* Private Key: A secret key used for decryption and digital signatures, kept confidential by the user.
* Public Key: A key openly shared with others, used for encryption and verification of digital signatures.
* Certificate Signing Request (CSR): A formal request from a user to a CA for a digital certificate, containing the user's public key and other identifying information.
* Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): The complete domain name for a specific website or server, including all levels of the domain hierarchy.

## Subject Name Attributes

Common Name (CN) vs. Subject Alternative Name (SAN):

* CN (Deprecated): Historically used to identify the server's FQDN, but now considered less reliable due to potential misinterpretation by browsers.
* SAN (Preferred): Specifically designed to represent various identifiers (FQDNs, IP addresses), offering better validation. Browsers should prioritize SAN over CN if present.

SAN Best Practices:

* Multiple Domains/Subdomains: The SAN field allows a single certificate to cover multiple subdomains (e.g., www.comptia.org and members.comptia.org) or even different top-level domains.
* Wildcard Domains: A wildcard character (\*) in the SAN field covers all subdomains to a single level (e.g., \*.comptia.org).

Additional Certificate Fields:

* Organization (O): The legal name of the organization associated with the certificate.
* Organizational Unit (OU): The department within the organization responsible for the certificate.
* Locality (L): The city or town where the organization is located.
* State (ST): The state or province where the organization is located.
* Country (C): The two-letter country code where the organization is located.

Distinguished Name (DN):

* A concatenation of CN, O, OU, L, ST, and C fields, forming a unique identifier for the certificate subject.

Certificate Types Beyond Server Identification:

* Email Certificates: Used for user accounts, with the SAN field representing an RFC 822 email address.
* Code-Signing Certificates: Verify the authenticity of software publishers or developers, focusing on validating organization and locale details rather than SAN.

## Certificate Revocation

Revocation vs. Suspension:

* Revoked Certificate: A certificate that is permanently invalidated and cannot be reinstated.
* Suspended Certificate: A certificate that is temporarily invalidated but can be re-enabled.

Reasons for Revocation or Suspension:

* Key compromise
* Business closure
* User leaving the company
* Domain name change
* Certificate misuse
* Other specified reasons

Certificate Revocation List (CRL):

* A list maintained by the CA of all revoked and suspended certificates.
* Contains information such as publish period, distribution points, validity period, and signature.
* Accessible to anyone relying on the CA's certificates.

CRL Limitations:

* Risk of accepting revoked certificates before the CRL is updated.
* Some legacy software may not be configured to perform CRL checking.

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):

* An alternative method for checking certificate status in real-time.
* Details of the OCSP responder service are usually included in the certificate.
* Most OCSP servers can directly query the certificate database for real-time status.

## Key Management

Key management encompasses the operational procedures involved in the various stages of a cryptographic key's lifecycle. The key lifecycle typically includes the following stages:

* Key Generation:
* The process of creating either an asymmetric key pair (public and private keys) or a symmetric secret key.
* Key strength and cipher choice are crucial considerations during this stage.
* Storage:
* Safeguarding private or secret keys from unauthorized access, loss, or damage.
* Employing secure storage mechanisms like hardware security modules (HSMs) or encrypted key stores is essential.
* Revocation:
* In the event of a key compromise, revocation renders the key invalid and unusable.
* Re-encryption of data previously encrypted with the compromised key is necessary.
* Expiration and Renewal:
* Setting an expiration date for a key enhances security by limiting its lifespan.
* Keys can be renewed upon expiration, either by reusing the existing key pair or generating a new one.
* Decentralized vs. Centralized Key Management:
* Decentralized: Keys are generated and managed directly on the device or user account using the certificate. This approach is easy to deploy but can make key compromise detection difficult.
* Centralized: Keys are generated and stored on a dedicated server or appliance, typically using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) for communication with other devices and applications.

## Key Escrow

Key Loss and Damage:

* Losing or damaging a private or secret key can result in the irreversible loss of access to encrypted data.
* Creating multiple copies of a key increases the risk of compromise and makes detection more challenging.

Mitigation Strategies:

* Escrow:
* Involves storing a copy (or parts) of a key with a trusted third party.
* Reduces the risk of total key loss and enables recovery in case of emergencies.
* M of N Control:
* Requires a quorum (M) of authorized individuals (N) to agree before a key can be accessed or used.
* Enhances security by preventing a single person from having complete control over a key.

Key Recovery Process:

* Key Splitting:
* A key can be divided into multiple parts, each held by a different escrow provider.
* This minimizes the risk of a single point of compromise.
* Key Recovery Agent (KRA):
* An individual or entity authorized to access a key held in escrow.
* Recovery policies often require multiple KRAs to authorize key access, mitigating the risk of impersonation.

## Encryption Supporting Confidentiality

Encryption and Data Security:

* Encryption plays a crucial role in safeguarding data confidentiality by rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
* This protection applies to data at rest, in transit, and in use.

Three States of Data:

* Data at Rest: Data stored on persistent storage media like hard drives, SSDs, or USB drives.
* Data in Transit (Data in Motion): Data transmitted over a network, such as emails, website traffic, or file transfers.
* Data in Use (Data in Processing): Data actively being processed in volatile memory like RAM, CPU registers, or cache.

Bulk Encryption:

* Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES): Preferred for encrypting large amounts of data (megabytes or gigabytes) due to its speed and efficiency.
* Asymmetric Encryption (e.g., RSA, ECC): Not ideal for bulk encryption due to computational overhead and slower processing speeds.
* Hybrid Approach: Most systems utilize a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption:
* Key Encryption Key (KEK): An asymmetric key pair used to encrypt the Data Encryption Key (DEK).
* Data Encryption Key (DEK): A symmetric key used to encrypt the actual data.
* Process: The DEK is encrypted with the KEK's public key, and the user's private key (protected by credentials) is required to decrypt the DEK to access the data.

## Disk and File Encryption

Data at rest encryption encompasses various storage mechanisms, each offering different levels of security and flexibility:

1. Full Disk Encryption (FDE):

* Encrypts the entire contents of a storage device, including metadata and free space.
* Primarily protects against physical theft of the disk.
* Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) are hardware-based FDE solutions.

2. Partition Encryption:

* Encrypts specific partitions on a storage device, allowing for selective protection of different data types.
* Partitions can be encrypted using different keys, offering flexibility.

3. Volume Encryption:

* Encrypts a storage resource with a single file system (e.g., a removable disk, HDD/SSD partition, or RAID array).
* Often implemented as software applications (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).
* May or may not encrypt free space and/or file metadata.

4. File Encryption:

* Encrypts individual files or folders.
* Requires file system support (e.g., EFS works with NTFS).

Additional Considerations:

* Metadata: Metadata can reveal information about files and should be considered for encryption.
* Free Space: Unallocated space may contain remnants of deleted files and could be a security risk.
* TPM/HSM: If available, these hardware modules can securely store encryption keys for enhanced protection.

## Database Encryption

Database encryption aims to protect sensitive data stored in structured databases. This is particularly important due to the often confidential or personal nature of data stored in databases. Here's how it works:

1. Database Structure:

* Data is organized in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields).
* Tables are stored as files on a volume, accessed through a Database Management System (DBMS) using a language like SQL.

3. Encryption Levels:

* Disk/Volume Encryption: Basic protection against theft of the storage media, but can impact performance.
* DBMS/Plugin Encryption: More commonly used, offering different levels of granularity:

5. Database-Level Encryption (Transparent Data Encryption - TDE):

* Encrypts all data transferred between disk and memory.
* Protects data at rest and in transit within the database system.

7. Record-Level Encryption:

* Protects individual records using separate keys.
* Offers granular control over data access, especially for sensitive information.
* Cell/Column Encryption: Encrypts specific fields within a table.

9. Cell/Column Encryption (Always Encrypted):

* Data remains encrypted in memory and is only decrypted when the client application provides the key.
* Enhances privacy by separating duties between database administrators and data owners.

11. Record-Level Encryption Example (Health Insurer):

* Each customer's data is encrypted with a unique key pair, ensuring fine-grained access control and compliance with privacy regulations.

## Transport Encryption and Key Exchange

Transport encryption secures data while it's being transmitted over a network, safeguarding it from unauthorized access. Various encryption products exist for different network solutions:

Types of Transport Encryption:

* Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): Secures traffic on wireless networks.
* Internet Protocol Security (IPsec): Creates Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to secure traffic between endpoints over untrusted networks.
* Transport Layer Security (TLS): Protects application data (e.g., web, email) over public networks.

Key Exchange and Encryption Process:

1. Obtain Public Key: The sender (Alice) gets the recipient's (Bob) public key, usually from a digital certificate.
2. Encrypt Message: Alice encrypts the message using a symmetric session key (e.g., AES).
3. Encrypt Session Key: Alice encrypts the session key with Bob's public key.
4. Digital Envelope: The encrypted session key is attached to the ciphertext in a digital envelope and sent to Bob.
5. Decrypt Session Key: Bob uses his private key to decrypt the session key.
6. Decrypt Message: Bob uses the decrypted session key to decrypt the message.

Integrity and Authenticity:

* Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC): Combines the session key with a message hash to ensure integrity and authenticity.
* Authenticated Encryption (AE): A symmetric cipher mode that provides both confidentiality and integrity/authenticity.

## Perfect Forward Secrecy

Digital Envelope Basics:

* Parties exchange or agree on a secret key for symmetric encryption.
* Original method involved server and client exchanging keys protected by the server's key pair.
* Vulnerability: If server's private key is compromised, recorded session data can be decrypted.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):

* Mitigates the risk of basic key exchange.
* Uses Diffie-Hellman (D-H) key agreement to create ephemeral session keys without the server's private key.
* Enables Alice and Bob to derive the same shared secret by sharing some values while keeping others private.
* Authenticity of server-sent values is proven using a digital signature.

Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE):

* PFS implementation using modular arithmetic.
* Ephemeral session keys prevent future server compromises from affecting recorded data.
* Even if one session's key is compromised, others remain confidential.
* Makes cryptanalysis of the entire "conversation" much harder.

Elliptic Curve DHE (ECDHE):

* More common implementation of PFS now.

## Salting and Key stretching

* Entropy and Key Generation: The strength of cryptographic keys relies on their randomness (entropy). User-generated passwords often lack sufficient entropy.
* Salting: A technique to enhance password security by adding a random value (salt) to the password before hashing. This makes precomputed rainbow tables ineffective.
* Key Stretching: A process that strengthens weak keys by repeatedly hashing them with additional input (like a salt). This makes brute-force attacks much slower and computationally expensive.
* Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2): A widely used algorithm for key stretching, particularly in WPA security.

## Blockchain

* Structure: A blockchain is a growing list of records (blocks) linked together with cryptography. Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a hash of the previous block.
* Security: The chaining of blocks ensures data integrity. Any change to a block invalidates subsequent blocks, making tampering evident.
* Decentralization: Blockchains are distributed across a peer-to-peer network, eliminating single points of failure and promoting trust.
* Transparency: Transactions are publicly viewable, enhancing accountability and reducing fraud.
* Applications: Blockchain technology has potential in various fields, including finance, legal, copyright, voting, identity management, and data storage.

## Obfuscation

Obfuscation: The practice of making data or messages difficult to understand or discover.

Steganography: Hiding information within another file or medium (covertext). It can provide confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation.

Data Masking: Redacting sensitive data by replacing it with placeholder characters (e.g., "x") or preserving the format while obscuring the actual values. Used for de-identification.

Tokenization: Replacing sensitive data with random tokens, storing the original values separately in a token vault. Reversible, used as an alternative to encryption due to regulatory considerations.

De-identification: The process of obfuscating personal data to protect privacy while allowing data sharing.
