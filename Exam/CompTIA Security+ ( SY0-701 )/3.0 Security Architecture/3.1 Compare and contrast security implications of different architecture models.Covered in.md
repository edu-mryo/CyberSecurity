## ARCHITECTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONCEPTS

This section explores the fundamentals of network architecture and its connection to secure business operations. It highlights that network architecture encompasses the strategic placement of components like media, devices, protocols, and data. It also explains how a secure network infrastructure and application architecture are essential for facilitating secure business workflows, like email provisioning. The example of email provisioning underscores the importance of addressing security considerations such as access control, data protection, and controlled communication between trusted and untrusted networks.

 Breaking down concepts and terms

- **Network architecture** involves making thoughtful decisions about the arrangement of various network elements like media, devices, protocols, and data assets.
- **Network infrastructure** forms the foundation for network connectivity, consisting of media, appliances, and protocols that facilitate communication.
- **Network applications** leverage the infrastructure to enable crucial business activities.
- **Data assets**, the valuable information generated, stored, and exchanged during business operations, require robust protection.
- **Secure network infrastructure and application architecture** play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive business processes.
- **Workflows** refer to the sequence of tasks a business needs to accomplish.
- **Security** encompasses the critical attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Access control** is pivotal in ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access specific resources, while unauthorized entities are denied.
- **Email mailbox servers** store vital data assets and need stringent access control and high availability to cater to legitimate users.
- **Mail transfer servers** interface with the untrusted internet, necessitating careful control over communications between trusted and untrusted networks.
- **Policy-based controls** are crucial for regulating data and software movement in and out of the network.
- **Network segmentation** is key for isolating systems with varying security requirements, minimizing vulnerabilities.

## NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE

This text focuses on using the OSI model to understand network infrastructure. It describes different layers and functions in a network, along with the devices and protocols that handle these tasks.

**Breaking down concepts and terms**:

- **OSI Model**: A framework for classifying network functions into seven distinct layers.
- **PHY Layer (Layer 1)**: The physical layer dealing with transmission mediums like cables and radio waves.
- **Nodes**: Devices on a network, classified as hosts (initiate data transfers) or intermediary nodes (forward traffic).
- **LAN and WAN**: Local Area Networks (single site) and Wide Area Networks (larger scope).
- **Addressing**: Each network node has a unique address for identification.
- **Switches**: Forward frames within a LAN based on MAC addresses (Layer 2).
- **Wireless Access Points**: Bridge between wired and wireless networks (Layer 2).
- **Routers**: Forward packets between networks based on IP addresses (Layer 3).
- **Transport Protocols (TCP/UDP)**: Enable data exchange between clients and servers (Layer 4).
- **Application Protocols**: Support user-level services like web browsing and email (Layer 7).
- **DNS**: Translates domain names into IP addresses (Layer 7).

## SWITCHING INFRASTRUCTURE CONSIDERATION

This text provides a comprehensive overview of network infrastructure, particularly emphasizing the topology and security aspects of on-premises networks. It elaborates on the concept of structured cabling and the limitations of the basic star topology, highlighting the importance of hierarchical design for scalability and security. The role of routers in creating separate broadcast domains and enabling a zone-based security model is also discussed.

Breaking down concepts and terms:

- **Network Topology:** The physical or logical arrangement of nodes and links in a network.
- **On-premises Network (Enterprise LAN):** A network installed and managed by a single company at a specific location.
- **Structured Cabling:** A standardized way to connect workstations to network switches via wall ports and patch panels.
- **Star Topology:** A network layout where all nodes connect to a central switch, facilitating communication between any two connected hosts.
- **Broadcast Domain:** A network segment where broadcasts are forwarded to all connected devices.
- **Hierarchical Design:** A network design approach that utilizes multiple forwarding layers (access, distribution, core) for improved scalability and security.
- **Zone-based Security Model:** A security approach that divides the network into zones with varying access policies.
- **Layer 3 Switch:** A networking device capable of both routing and switching functions.
- **Equipment/Server Room:** A secure area for housing servers and core networking equipment.

## ROUTING INFRASTRUCTURE CONSIDERATIONS

Overall summary: This passage explains how layer 3 forwarding, or routing, uses IP addresses to create logical networks and subnets, enabling effective traffic control and security through access control rules. It also covers the concept of VLANs, which allow for the segmentation of hosts connected to the same switch, enhancing security and control within a network.

Breaking down concepts and terms:

- **Layer 3 Forwarding (Routing):** Directs network traffic based on IP addresses, defining the logical segmentation of networks and subnets.
- **IP Address:** A unique address assigned to each device on a network, allowing it to send and receive data. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses.
- **Subnet:** A logical subdivision of an IP network, creating separate broadcast domains for improved management and security.
- **ARP and ND:** Protocols used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for communication between devices.
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN):** A logical grouping of devices on a network, regardless of their physical location, creating separate broadcast domains.
- **VLAN ID:** A unique identifier assigned to each VLAN, ranging from 2 to 4094.
- **Access Control Rule:** A security measure that controls the flow of traffic between different zones or VLANs.
