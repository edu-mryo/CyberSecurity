## ARCHITECTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONCEPTS

This section explores the fundamentals of network architecture and its connection to secure business operations. It highlights that network architecture encompasses the strategic placement of components like media, devices, protocols, and data. It also explains how a secure network infrastructure and application architecture are essential for facilitating secure business workflows, like email provisioning. The example of email provisioning underscores the importance of addressing security considerations such as access control, data protection, and controlled communication between trusted and untrusted networks.

 Breaking down concepts and terms

- **Network architecture** involves making thoughtful decisions about the arrangement of various network elements like media, devices, protocols, and data assets.
- **Network infrastructure** forms the foundation for network connectivity, consisting of media, appliances, and protocols that facilitate communication.
- **Network applications** leverage the infrastructure to enable crucial business activities.
- **Data assets**, the valuable information generated, stored, and exchanged during business operations, require robust protection.
- **Secure network infrastructure and application architecture** play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive business processes.
- **Workflows** refer to the sequence of tasks a business needs to accomplish.
- **Security** encompasses the critical attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Access control** is pivotal in ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access specific resources, while unauthorized entities are denied.
- **Email mailbox servers** store vital data assets and need stringent access control and high availability to cater to legitimate users.
- **Mail transfer servers** interface with the untrusted internet, necessitating careful control over communications between trusted and untrusted networks.
- **Policy-based controls** are crucial for regulating data and software movement in and out of the network.
- **Network segmentation** is key for isolating systems with varying security requirements, minimizing vulnerabilities.
