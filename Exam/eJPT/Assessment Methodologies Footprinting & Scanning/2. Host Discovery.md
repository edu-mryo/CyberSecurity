**1. Ping Sweep**

- **Mechanism:** Sends ICMP Echo Request packets (commonly known as "pings") to a range of IP addresses. If a device is alive and responding, it will send an ICMP Echo Reply.
- **Pros:** Simple and widely supported. Can quickly identify active hosts on a network.
- **Cons:** Can be easily blocked by firewalls or network devices. May not be effective in detecting hosts behind NAT or filtered networks.

**2. ARP Scan**

- **Mechanism:** Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and broadcasts ARP requests on the local network. It asks, "Who has this IP address?", expecting a response from the device with that IP, thus revealing its MAC address and confirming its presence.
- **Pros:** Very effective for discovering hosts on the local network segment. Can bypass some firewalls that block ICMP.
- **Cons:** Limited to the local network broadcast domain. Not useful for discovering hosts on remote networks.

**3. TCP SYN Scan**

- **Mechanism:** Sends a TCP SYN packet (the first step in establishing a TCP connection) to a target port.
    - If the port is open, the target responds with a SYN-ACK packet.
    - If the port is closed, the target responds with an RST packet.
    - If the port is filtered, no response is received.
- **Pros:** Considered a "stealthy" scan as it doesn't complete the TCP handshake, making it less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems. Can identify open, closed, and filtered ports.
- **Cons:** Requires raw socket access on the scanning machine. Can be slower than other scan types.

**4. UDP Ping**

- **Mechanism:** Sends a UDP packet to a target port. If the port is closed, the target may respond with an ICMP Port Unreachable message. If the port is open, there's usually no response.
- **Pros:** Can discover open UDP ports and potentially identify some operating systems based on ICMP error messages.
- **Cons:** Often less reliable than TCP scans due to the lack of a guaranteed response. Can generate a lot of network traffic if scanning many ports.

**5. TCP ACK Scan**

- **Mechanism:** Sends a TCP packet with the ACK flag set, simulating an already established connection.
    - If the port is unfiltered, the target will respond with an RST packet.
    - If the port is filtered, there will be no response.
- **Pros:** Can help determine if a firewall is stateful (tracking connections) or stateless. Can sometimes bypass simple firewalls.
- **Cons:** Not as effective as other scan types for determining open ports. Can be unreliable in some network configurations.

**6. SYN-ACK Ping**

- **Mechanism:** A variation of the TCP SYN scan. It sends a SYN packet, but instead of expecting a SYN-ACK, it waits for an RST packet, indicating a live host.
- **Pros:** Can be useful in situations where SYN scans are blocked but RST packets are allowed.
- **Cons:** Similar limitations to TCP SYN scans. Can be unreliable in some network setups.
