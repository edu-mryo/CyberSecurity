1. **Application Layer (Layer 7):** You open your email client (the application) and compose the message. The email client formats the text, attaches any files, and prepares it for sending.
    
2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):** The email client might compress the attached files to save space and encrypt the entire email for security. It also ensures the email is formatted in a way that your friend's email client can understand.
    
3. **Session Layer (Layer 5):** A session is established between your email client and the mail server, allowing for ongoing communication. This ensures that the email is sent in its entirety and that any disruptions don't cause data loss.
    
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):** The email is broken into smaller packets, each numbered and labeled with the destination address (your friend's email address). The Transport layer (using TCP) ensures reliable delivery, reordering packets if necessary and requesting retransmission if any are lost.
    
5. **Network Layer (Layer 3):** Each packet receives an IP address (like a postal code) indicating its destination. Routers on the internet use these IP addresses to guide the packets towards your friend's network.
    
6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):** At each network hop (router or switch), the packets are encapsulated in frames with MAC addresses (like street addresses within a neighborhood). Switches use these MAC addresses to deliver the frames to the correct device within the local network.
    
7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):** The frames are converted into electrical or optical signals and transmitted over the physical medium (cables, fiber optics, or wireless). These signals travel across the vast network infrastructure, hopping between routers and switches until they reach your friend's network.
    

**Arrival at the Destination**

The process reverses at your friend's end:

1. **Physical Layer:** The signals are received and converted back into frames.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Frames are checked for errors and MAC addresses are used for local delivery.
3. **Network Layer:** IP addresses guide the packets to your friend's computer.
4. **Transport Layer:** Packets are reassembled into the original email, ensuring all data is received correctly.
5. **Session Layer:** The session is closed, confirming successful transmission.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Any encryption is removed, and files are decompressed.
7. **Application Layer:** Your friend's email client receives the email and displays it, complete with your congratulatory message!
